# Sphero-2.0
Hi, all
Our group robot is Sphero 2.0
We're trying to make this robot can to take image recognition by
Mount the cart on top so this is like cover the ball and have a trailer on the back that hold Pi3 is place
and mount a camera on the top so it can do image recognition. Find some items that we need from the floor
and stream to our laptop/computer.

Thanks
