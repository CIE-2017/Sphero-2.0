My part is doing mounting part and moving the sphero by raspberry pi
At the first time, I cannot connect the raspberry pi with bluetooth in Raspbian,and The mounting part the wood sheet cannot get along well with the sphero 
However,I download the Vmware to connect the Sphero with Ubuntu instead of Rapsbian, so fortunately I can connect the Sphero with bluetooth 
but the nodejs of the Sphero (NPM) cannot conect with it (https://www.npmjs.com/package/sphero), so I asked TA for help, and he find the API 
of the Sphero in Python called KUlKA (https://github.com/zdanowiczkonrad/PythonSphero), and I can simply connect it, and now I can move it 
by using this API (I'm so in LUCK because I can connect it with Raspberry pi Bluetooth)
